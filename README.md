## Requirements
To be able to play you must have the following:
* C compiler (such as GCC, Clang, etc)
* Allegro 5

## How to play
404 Word Jump was inspired by Google's Dinosaur Game that can be played when attempting to access a site while offline.

The base concept is the same, but there's a twist: to jump you must type a character that forms a valid word from the chosen theme!

For now there are 2 available themes: Fruits + Vegetables, and Animals.

You start the game off with 3 available backspaces to correct misspelled words and typos, but once they're over, you're on your own.

**But don't think you can just type the same word over and over!** Depending on the difficulty you choose, you can't repeat the last X words, on Easy mode it's only 2, but on expert mode, you can't repeat any words at all!*


*If you type all possible words, you will die inevitably, but that sounds easier that it actually is.
